# ARTIE Client Introduction

ARTIE Client is the component whose function is to gather information about the user \(facial images, mouse and keyboard interactions,...\) and then to send it to ARTIE architecture. This client is composed by a central application \(the client\) and by modules \(sensors\).

Currently, the following ARTIE Sensors have been developped:

* [Keyboard and Mouse Sensor](https://github.com/ARTIEROCKS/artie-sensor-keyboard-mouse.git).
* [Screen Sensor](https://github.com/ARTIEROCKS/artie-sensor-screen.git).
